# UnitTestingAssignments

## Assignment 1

For this assignment, implement the ReverseStringShouldReturn test as found in Assignment1Tests.ProgramTest.

## Assignment 2

For this assignment, you have to create a test project for the Assignment2 project, and create and implement a test class for the StringReverser test.
The test project should be named "Assignment2Test"

## Assignment 3

For this assignment, you have to design and create a programme, from scratch with accompanying testing suite, which does the following:

1. The programme asks the user for a list of numbers from the user. The lenght of this list is arbitrary. **How you solve this is up to you.**
2. The programme asks the user for an operation. For this assignment, at least addition, multiplication, and average have to be implemented.
3. The programme performs the entered operation on the numbers the user has given, and gives the result back.

Other requirements:

- **Do not assume that user inputs are valid. Validation and error reporting are part of the assignment**
- Think about class responsibilities.
- Keep test coverage in mind.

Hand this in as two projects, added to the solution. The main project should be named "Assignment3" and the test project should be named "Assignment3Test".
